# insurance_price_prediction
Prediction Insurance price based on a customers data

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Check the dataset if it needs cleaning.
Check the dataset if it needs missing value treatment.
Check the dataset if it needs scaling.
Split data into training data and testing data.
Create a machine learning model to predict insurance charges depending on various independent features.
Check the accuracy of your model.


STEPS FOLLOWED

1. Importing required libraries.
2. Loading dataset.
3. Created a copy of the dataset
4. Got insights on the dataset.
5. Checked Statistical info about dataset.
6. Checked information on dataset.
7. Encoding dataset.
8. Checking correlation of columns.
9. Dropped two columns with lowest relation.
10. Splitting data into training set and testing set.
11. Importing five regression models (Linear Regression, KNN Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor).
12. Making objects of each model and creating a list of the objects.
13. Iterating through the models list, fitting training data in each model one by one.
14. Making predictions with test data using each model one by one.
15. Checking accuracy of each model one by one.
16. Created another copy of dataset.
17. Repeated the process without dropping the two columns with less corelation (got little bit better accuracy).
